Title: Band Stalk

Concept: Users will be able to search for whatever band they like. Information like the band bio, upcoming concerts, an option to purchase tickets, and live media of the band playing will come from YouTube and display once user inputs band.

APIS: Youtube API to bring up live music for that band so user can see if they like how the band sounds live. BandsInTown API for tickets, band info, venue, etc. 

Framework used: BootSwatch

User Experience: Our website will be a smooth interface for users to simply search for the band they're wanting to see live with a search bar on the top of the webpage. Once entered, the band information, upcoming events, and a photo of the band will appear in one container. Videos of the band performing live will show in the other container for the user to watch if they please.
